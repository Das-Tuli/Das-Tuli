# 👋 Hey there, I’m Das_Tuli!

I'm someone who genuinely enjoys coding and building things that make a difference! I’ve been working on some pretty exciting projects lately—like developing a smart traffic management system and even creating a secure crypto wallet. I love finding ways to take what I’m learning and apply it to real-world challenges.

## 🚀 A Little About Me
- 🌱 Right now, I’m really focused on **data structures** and how they can drive smarter tech solutions. My current project is a **Smart Traffic Management System** to help with city congestion and improve traffic flow.
- 🔐 I recently wrapped up a project on a **crypto wallet**—it was all about using cryptography to keep digital transactions safe. Super challenging but a lot of fun!
- 🧠 I’m building my skills in Python, data analysis, and algorithms. I think tech has amazing potential to create positive change, so I'm always on the lookout for ways to make an impact.
- 💼 I’d love to connect with other developers and work together on new ideas. If you’re into solving complex problems with code, let’s chat!
